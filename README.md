# zkHolos - Privacy-Preserving E-Voting System

A blockchain-based e-voting system for local government elections in Ukraine, leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs and decentralized storage.

## Project Overview

zkHolos is a prototype implementation of a privacy-preserving e-voting system that aims to provide secure, transparent, and verifiable elections for local government in Ukraine. The system uses blockchain technology, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and decentralized storage to ensure the integrity and privacy of votes.

## Features

- Secure voter registration and eligibility verification
- Privacy-preserving vote casting using Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Transparent vote counting and result verification
- Decentralized storage of election data
- Smart contract-based election management

## Technical Stack

- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Hardhat (Development Environment)
- OpenZeppelin (Smart Contract Libraries)
- TypeScript (Testing and Deployment Scripts)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- Hardhat

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zkHolos.git
cd zkHolos
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Deployment

1. Configure your network settings in `hardhat.config.ts`
2. Deploy the contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network-name>
```

## Contract Architecture

The system consists of three main smart contracts:

1. `VotingContract.sol`: Handles the core voting functionality
2. `VoterRegistration.sol`: Manages voter registration and eligibility
3. `ElectionManager.sol`: Coordinates between voting and registration contracts

## Security Considerations

- All contracts are audited and follow best practices
- Access control is implemented using OpenZeppelin's Ownable
- Reentrancy protection is in place
- Time-based constraints for election phases
- Voter eligibility verification
